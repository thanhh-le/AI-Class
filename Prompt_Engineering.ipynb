            "All three ideas meet the requirement for an \"event for 2 people.\" However, they **do not consistently meet 100% of the \"under $300\" requirement** due to language that encourages premium, gourmet, or multiple new purchases, which can easily push the cost over the limit without very careful budgeting.\n",

            "\n",
            "1.  **Gourmet Picnic & DIY Dessert Adventure:**\n",
            "    *   **Meets \"2 people\":** Yes, clearly designed for two (\"Curate...collaborative dessert-making\").\n",
            "    *   **Meets \"Under $300\":** **Potentially, but with a high risk of mismatch.**\n",
            "        *   **Mismatches/Critique:** The phrasing \"lavish picnic,\" \"artisan cheeses, charcuterie, and fine drinks\" immediately suggests a higher price point. A good selection of artisan cheeses and charcuterie can easily run $50-$100+. \"Fine drinks\" (e.g., a decent bottle of wine or champagne) can add another $30-$80+. Ingredients for \"macarons, éclairs\" are not cheap; almond flour, quality chocolate, and other specialty items can quickly add another $30-$60+. While it's *possible* to curate this under $300 with economical choices (e.g., buying a cheaper wine, fewer artisan items, or simpler desserts), the *description itself* implies a budget that could easily exceed $300 if taken literally. It doesn't inherently guarantee \"under $300.\"\n",

            "2.  **Stargazing & Cozy Charcuterie:**\n",
            "    *   **Meets \"2 people\":** Yes, \"intimate conversation under the stars\" implies two.\n",
            "    *   **Meets \"Under $300\":** **Potentially, but with a moderate risk of mismatch.**\n",
            "        *   **Mismatches/Critique:** Similar to the first idea, a \"luxurious charcuterie board\" can be expensive, easily running $50-$100+ depending on selections. While \"gourmet hot cocoa or cider\" is relatively inexpensive, the *travel* to a \"scenic, dark-sky spot\" could incur gas costs, especially if it's a significant drive. If they need to purchase a new \"cozy blanket\" rather than using one they own, that could add $30-$100+. Again, it's *doable* under $300 with careful choices, but the description leans towards spending more than the bare minimum, making the budget a concern.\n",

            "3.  **\"Choose Your Own Adventure\" Cocktail Lab & Game Night:**\n",
            "    *   **Meets \"2 people\":** Yes, \"experimenting...together,\" \"evening of playful indulgence.\"\n",
            "    *   **Meets \"Under $300\":** **Highly unlikely to meet this requirement without significant existing supplies, representing a significant mismatch.**\n",
            "        *   **Mismatches/Critique:** \"Transform your home into a bespoke cocktail lab, experimenting with new recipes and ingredients together\" is the biggest budget killer here. To create a \"lab\" and experiment with *new* recipes often requires purchasing multiple base spirits (gin, vodka, rum, whiskey), various liqueurs, bitters, specialty mixers, fresh fruits/garnishes, and syrups. Even buying just 3-4 decent bottles of liquor can easily cost $150-$250+. Add in mixers, garnishes, and \"gourmet snacks,\" and the $300 limit is almost certainly exceeded, especially if they are starting from a very basic home bar. If they already have a well-stocked bar, it's feasible, but the idea doesn't state this assumption and encourages acquiring \"new ingredients.\" A new board game could also add $30-$60 if they don't already own a \"selection of engaging board games.\" This idea has the highest probability of breaching the $300 budget.\n",

            "\n",
            "None of the ideas meet 100% of the requirements *as described*, primarily due to the \"under $300\" budget. While all are excellent concepts for two people, the language used to describe the \"gourmet,\" \"lavish,\" \"luxurious,\" and \"new ingredients\" aspects makes it highly probable that the cost would exceed the $300 limit without active and strict budgeting that the ideas themselves don't explicitly suggest. Idea #3 is the most problematic for the budget.\n",
